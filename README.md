# How to Use

- Change order of fields in note: Translation, Hiragana, Kanji
- Export into .txt file
- make sure no Translation field has <div or nbsp 
- run script into txt file
- import out.txt into Anki (log will show only updated cards, if new ones are added something went wrong)
- Change order of fields back to Hiragana, Kanji, Translation

Obs: this CAN work for other decks but it was specifically coded for my Anki vocabulary deck
